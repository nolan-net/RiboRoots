# RiboRoots

## Overview

RiboRoots is a streamlined bioinformatics application focused on analyzing and visualizing the phylogenetic relationships of bacterial strains. This project integrates Python-based algorithms for the comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences to construct detailed phylogenetic trees. Utilizing 'rrnDB version 5.8', a comprehensive dataset from the Center for Microbial Systems at the University of Michigan, RiboRoots includes data on several thousand bacterial strains and their corresponding 16S rRNA genes.

## Objective

The aim of RiboRoots is to develop a program using Python that allows users to select bacterial strains, compare their RNA sequences, and visually represent the relationships through phylogenetic trees.

## Key Features

1. **Reliable Data Source**: Incorporates 'rrnDB version 5.8', a dataset from the Center for Microbial Systems, University of Michigan.
